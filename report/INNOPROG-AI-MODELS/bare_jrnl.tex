% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{pdfpages}
\usepackage{cite}
\usepackage{hyperref}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.

\usepackage{listings}
\usepackage[english, russian]{babel}

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!

% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

\section{Introduction}
\label{introdunction:intro}

A proposal was received to develop AI model to build an individual educational plan for users of the company INNOPROG at the request of this company [last page of this article].

\subsection{Few Words about Customer}
INNOPROG is an online educational service in Telegram for studying IT disciplines, where an individual learning plan is built for each student. To increase efficiency and involvement in the learning process, we use an interactive training system, which includes capacious informative videos and a variable selection of tasks, which is adjusted based on the level of knowledge of each student using artificial intelligence. In addition, we offer a flexible office hours system, which consists of individual lessons with a teacher at a time convenient for the student, as well as 24-hour support from our mentors via chat. By purchasing a monthly subscription, our student gets access to all educational modules and 240 minutes of individual lessons with a teacher.

\subsection{Work Plan}
It was decided to implement two models that could help the company automate and improve the interaction with the users within their educational plans.

\subsubsection{Task Complexity Prediction}
The objective here is to create a model that can accurately determine the appropriate level of task difficulty for each user. This decision will be based on the user's history of problem-solving success rates and their preferred level of challenge. By analyzing past performance data and stated preferences, the model can assign tasks that are neither too easy nor too difficult, thereby optimizing the learning curve and keeping users engaged and challenged.
\subsubsection{Chat Assistant}
The purpose of the Chat Assistant is to provide real-time support to users. This assistant should be capable of handling inquiries related to both the educational tasks and organizational aspects of the user's plans. It needs to understand and process various question types and deliver accurate and helpful responses. This involves training the model on a wide range of topics and ensuring it has access to up-to-date and relevant information.


% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
%

% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centering
%\subfloat[Case I]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%

%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Chat Assistant}
Since our goal is automation the answer the users' questions, we need to build a language model that can understand which problem the user asks about and give an appropriate answer. And this behavior is inherent in the GPT model. The GPT is the model that can answer the questions. It is already a solution for the chat assistance.


\section{Methodology}
Both models mentioned in Section \ref{introdunction:intro} are considered here as separate tasks.

\subsection{Task Complexity Prediction}
The first task facing us is the ability to predict the possible future tasks for the users.

\subsubsection{Dataset}
The problem here is that the initial task complexity that was given by an instructor does not consider the level of the students (users). Due to the different levels of students, tasks may appear both more difficult and easier than they actually are. That's why it was decided to consider the users' subjective estimation of the task complexity that was solved by them.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
        Feature 1 & User's estimation of a task complexity \\
        \hline
        Feature 2 & Time spent on solving the problem\\
        \hline
        Feature 3 & Instructor's task complexity\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Dataset for task complexity}
    \label{tab:task complexity}
\end{table}

[Tab. \ref{tab:task complexity}] shows which feature was taken to train the model. The dataset includes the time spent on solving the problem. And this time is also estimated by the users themselves.

\subsubsection{Model}
The model is the Neural Network with embeddings and LSTM layer. Here you can find the model structure in initialization function:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
    def __init__(self,
                 input_dim,
                 embedding_dim,
                 hidden_dim,
                 output_dim,
                 n_layers,
                 bidirectional,
                 dropout):

        super(Model, self).__init__()

        self.word_embeddings = nn.Embedding(input_dim, embedding_dim, padding_idx=1)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim, hidden_dim, bidirectional = bidirectional)
        self.hidden2tag = nn.Linear(
            hidden_dim * 2 if bidirectional else hidden_dim,
            output_dim
        )
\end{lstlisting}.

\subsection{Chat Assistant}
This model is a more complex task, since here the Large Language Model should be trained to answer the user's question in the chat.

\subsubsection{Dataset}
The task involves developing a chat assistant using a language model trained on a dataset of conversations. The dataset comprises 300 question-and-answer pairs with users, which is relatively small for effective training.

\subsubsection{Model}
To overcome the data limitation, the decision was made to utilize the Russian T5 model. This model is leveraged due to its architecture, which is suitable for understanding and generating human-like text. Training the T5 model on the available conversations aims to equip the chat assistant with the ability to respond accurately to user inquiries.

The choice of the Russian T5 model may also be influenced by its pre-training on a diverse text corpus, making it potentially more adept at handling the nuances of language with limited training data. However, the success of the model will largely depend on the quality and relevance of the dataset it is trained on.

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
Furthermore, it's important to consider the possibility of data augmentation or the use of transfer learning techniques, where a model pre-trained on a large corpus is fine-tuned on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This approach can help in improving the performance of the model despite the dataset's size constraints.

The ultimate goal is to create a chat assistant that can seamlessly engage with users, providing them with accurate and contextually relevant answers, thereby enhancing the user experience. The effectiveness of the T5 model in this application will need to be evaluated through testing and user feedback.

\section{Experiments and Evaluation}

\subsection{Task Complexity Prediction}
The model that predicts the possible tasks that are suitable to users shows good results. That's why it was decided to integrate the model into the bot for testing it in real time. This model will help the users to get tasks that are not so hard for them, but still develop their skills and increase their knowledge.

\subsection{Chat Assistant}
To address the issue of limited computing resources and extended training times associated with a 60-epoch schedule on a small dataset, an optimized approach has been applied. The resultant output, though derived from this constrained environment, successfully generates the anticipated results. This can be observed in the provided figure which visually represents the effectiveness of the solution under these restrictive conditions.


[Fig. \ref{fig:task_time}] shows how the process of the collecting the information for the predicting the next tasks is organized.

\section{Analysis and Observations}
\subsection{Chat Assistant}
The model built from scratch and trained on small data give the results that can only be considered as bad ones. That's why this model will be implemented in future with the help of already existing model from OpenAI, and the work will held.

For example, on the question "Как установить PyCharm?", we got the following answer:

"Charm — это проект, который помогает справиться с задачей. Если файлов таких нет, то нужно создать в PyCharm самостоятельно - любую файловую программу. Например, pyCharm понимает, что такое PyCharm и ему нужно использовать, чтобы создать файл на устройстве. Чтобы понять, где искать файл, достаточно нажать правой кнопкой мыши на название открытого файла или сам файл в боте И далее запустить в боте название открытого файла или сам файл, чтобы открыть файл в папке. Чтобы открыть папку, Вам потребуется создать файл в папке. Там же вы и найдёте сам файл pyCharm, где Вы и найдёте открытый файл".



\section{Conclusion}
We've successfully developed a model that assigns tasks to users, facilitating their learning process. This model is instrumental in guiding users through a series of educational activities designed to ensure they achieve success in their learning objectives. The accomplishment of this phase signifies that the project's goals regarding user engagement and education have been met.

However, the project's scope extends beyond this initial success. The next phase involves the development and implementation of a separate model that will function within INNOPROG as a chat assistant. This new model will require careful integration and testing to ensure that it enhances the user experience by providing interactive, responsive assistance. The work on this model is ongoing, and it will involve refining algorithms to interpret and respond to user queries effectively, as well as ensuring the chat assistant can guide users through the educational content seamlessly.

The completion of this second model is crucial for the overall project, as it aims to provide a comprehensive and interactive learning platform. The integration of the chat assistant will not only augment the educational framework but also offer a more personalized and adaptive learning experience. This two-pronged approach ensures that the project not only delivers content but also engages users interactively, thus fulfilling the dual objectives of the project.

INNOPROG, the client for whom the educational model and chat assistant have been developed, has expressed satisfaction with the delivered products. Their feedback indicates that the educational tasks model has been seamlessly integrated into their existing systems, enhancing the learning experience for users. The success of this implementation is a testament to the project's alignment with INNOPROG's vision for an innovative educational platform. The positive reception of the educational model has set a strong foundation for the continued development and integration of the chat assistant component. INNOPROG's endorsement of the work done so far provides additional motivation and validation for the project team as they move forward with the next phase, ensuring that the final product will meet the high standards and expectations that have been established.
